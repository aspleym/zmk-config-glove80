# ZMK config for Glove80

This repository is made out of a template from MoErgo's Glove80 template repository.

### Requirements:
For this layout to work as intended, the `US intl. Altgr-weur` layout variant must be set in your OS.

> Note, there is a symlink at `config/zmk-helpers`. To find the repository, go [here](https://github.com/urob/zmk-helpers).

### Features:
Here is a highlight of some of the major features in this config:
- With `US intl. Altgr` we now have access to Norwegian letters, using a header file for Norwegian (`keys_nb.h`)
- Colemak-DH layout
- Zmk-helper by Urob
- Timeless Homerow Mods
- WIP
